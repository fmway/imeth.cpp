# API Overview

Imeth is a modular library divided into namespaces and classes. I mention the term _category_ and _chapter_ previously, they are simply my way to say
a `branch` and a `header`. A category can be consisted of many chapters, just like a `branch` consisting many `headers`. Thus, imeth is a compilation of mathematical
categories and their chapters, which of course include their operations.

## Available Categories

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<imeth/linear>` | Linear equations and operations |
| `<imeth/operation>` | Bunch of general mathematical operations |
| `<imeth/geometry>` | Geometric shape calculations |
| `<imeth/base>` | Base conversions and operations |

Each category has their own chapters. And chapters are the actual APIs that you are going to use.
