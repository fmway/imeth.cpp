# imeth

The stupid name "imeth" can be concluded into two translation:
* **I + METH** â€“ Because I'm high on math equations like a guy high on meth.
* **IYAN + METH** Because Iyan (the original author) is high on math like a guy high on meth.

Even though both still share the same equal meaning.

Imeth is a lightweight C++ math library for exploring computational mathematics while testing the limit of author's C++ skill (and sanity).
It's a high modular-designed library, making it very likely to have so many branches and abstractions just to get a method done. Though the author believes
that modularity is the key to success. At least in his mind and his dream, it is.

## Why imeth?

When asked, "why?", it's not about the matter, **"why do I use imeth?"**. Instead, it's preferable to say that the real question is, **"why do I make imeth?"**.
No one, at least a sane being, is stupid enough to use imeth. Not even for fun I'd like to call them, sane, because someone who's sane will never hear the
name imeth in their life. Someone who's **insane** however, will.

Apart from so, imeth is meant to be entirely an **experiment that made public**. It can be interpreted as a CIA trick to make propaganda so that they can control the
world if they haven't. Or as **a funny silly project to practice the author's skill** while he learns C++ in his young age.

To me, **I'm not developing imeth to be productive**. It's more of **an experiment that I think I'd like to accomplish**.

## Features

Imeth comes with plenty handy features that I'd like point out:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic calculations
- **Linear Algebra**: Equation solving, matrix operations, and more
- **Factoring Quadratic Equation**: Methods to factor quadratic equations
- **Geometric Calculations**: 2D and 3D geometric operations
- **Base Conversions and Operations**: Convert and operate on numbers between different bases
- **Modular Design**: Clean, organized API with namespace separation
- **Simple API**: Clean interfaces for complex math

My favorite one is the linear algebra, especially the linear equation with variables. Which I think will be the best and will be the overglazed feature, by me.
